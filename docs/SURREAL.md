# Surreal Touch controller backend

This is an independent, integrated BLE backend for the **myMartek/Klepton `avp-play` branch**. Both Standard and Surreal sources compile into every generated game. Host, build and synthetic simulator checks pass. Both physical controllers connected on Vision Pro, and the tester confirmed working buttons, good hand-derived position and substantially improved sensor-only rotation. **Native positional tracking, fast-motion accuracy, radio recovery and physical vibration remain unverified.**

OpenSurreal has no LICENSE/COPYING file or express redistribution grant in this revision. Its source was inspected to establish its public APIs and interoperability facts, including UUIDs, packet layouts, handedness naming and coordinate conventions. **None of its implementation, UI, spatial session or package is copied, vendored, linked or downloaded by this build.** This is not a claim that the reference project is permissively licensed or that this was a clean-room process. Obtain an explicit license before replacing this backend with OpenSurreal or distributing any of that project's code.

New implementation files follow this repository's MIT license. There is no new third-party runtime dependency. Apple CoreBluetooth, ARKit, QuartzCore and SwiftUI are SDK frameworks. Existing ANGLE/MoltenVK licensing remains in `third-party-licenses`; the validation build uses their prebuilt slices from AVP Play release v1.1.15, toolchain `507-1954ecf`, verified against the release sidecar SHA-256.

## Selection and precedence

- Mac: `AVPPlayCore.ControllerMode`, persisted under `controllerMode`; default `standard`.
- Build: `KLEPTON_CONTROLLER_MODE=standard|surreal` becomes `KL_CONTROLLER_MODE_DEFAULT` and the built Info.plist's `KLControllerModeDefault`.
- Headset: `klepton.controllerMode` in this game's UserDefaults overrides the bundle default. An invalid value falls back to the bundle default, then Standard.
- `KleptonControllers` freezes the mode when the compositor is created. Exit and reopen the app to change modes after starting a game. Changing the Mac preference does not pair controllers or rewrite installed headset preferences.
- Standard follows the original Sense/hand/gamepad code. Surreal bypasses Sense polling, gamepad polling, accessory-provider discovery and pinch events. A missing controller is released and parked out of view; the other remains usable.
- Both routes use `submit(_:hand:)` and the existing `kl_ovrp_set_hand_motion` / `kl_ovrp_set_controller_input` seam. Game haptics are pulled from the same existing runtime queue.

## Pairing and calibration

In the game launcher, open Settings → Controllers, select Surreal Touch, turn on the controllers and select Discover. Connect the explicitly identified left and right devices. Names without an unambiguous Surreal Touch L/R token are rejected rather than guessed. Pairing, connection, battery (optional SIG battery service), input values, recalibration and vibration controls live on Vision Pro.

The last successful peripheral UUID for each hand is remembered locally. Reconnect retrieves those UUIDs without scanning. A lost link clears that hand immediately and retries on the BLE queue. Disconnect cancels retry for that hand. Bluetooth permission/power failures clear input and report status. There is no pairing on the Mac.

Discover includes peripherals already connected by visionOS, because system-connected controllers may no longer advertise. A system Bluetooth connection alone is not enough: select the controller in this app so it can subscribe to pose and button notifications. Disconnect and Vibration test appear only for a ready controller; an in-progress connection has a separate Cancel connection action. Connection events and first packet lengths are written to the local `Documents/surreal-ble.log` (capped at 256 KiB per launch) for hardware diagnostics. Pose/button streams are not logged per frame, and this logging never runs on the render thread.

After Start, hold each controller still with the corresponding hand visible and squeeze its grip. This explicitly registers the controller's native frame into the world. A reconnect, timestamp reset or stale/invalid pose requires calibration again. Initial calibration is intentionally not persisted across ARKit world origins or controller power cycles.

`KleptonCompositor` remains the sole ARKit-session owner. Its existing predicted hand anchors are converted by the existing `gripPose` convention and supplied to the Surreal cache. No second HandTrackingProvider or WorldTrackingProvider is started. World registration is gently corrected while the grip is held and native speed is below 0.35 m/s and 1.5 rad/s. Fast motion and occluded hands use the controller's native pose relative to the last registration. Releasing the grip freezes registration, so an empty hand cannot drag a controller sitting nearby.

### Optional position from hand tracking

In Settings → Controllers → Surreal Touch, enable **Position from hand tracking** before Start. It is **off by default**, persisted per game as `klepton.surreal.positionFromHands`, and never enabled by choosing Surreal Touch on the Mac. With it off, native positioning above is unchanged.

With it on, each controller's position comes directly from the matching compositor hand's predicted grip point. Rotation and angular velocity still come from the Surreal pose; buttons, triggers and sticks come only from the physical controller. After Start, look straight ahead and point both controllers level and forward, with sticks facing up  Keep hands visible, hold each grip still for half a second, then release. This explicitly defines forward from the level headset heading; it never uses wrist rotation. Rotation calibration is averaged over at least 350 ms of a stable reference (within 5 degrees, native angular speed below 0.35 rad/s and grip above 0.55), then latched. Grip release, hand loss, fast rotation or a reference discontinuity restarts an incomplete calibration. Once calibrated, holding or pressing grip during play cannot reorient the controller from hand-tracking estimates. Use **Reset forward alignment** to explicitly restart alignment; disconnect, stale BLE or changing position mode also reset it. Manual direction adjustments do not reset registration.

Calibration uses rotation only in this mode. Native position, native linear velocity and native positional confidence do not gate hand positioning; a fresh pose packet with a valid quaternion is still required. Linear velocity is computed from consecutive visible hand positions at presentation time, without a second prediction step. The native-position mode retains its existing continuous registration behavior.

A missing hand freezes its last position for at most 150 ms with zero linear velocity. Longer occlusion parks that controller and releases its game inputs until that hand returns; the other hand is independent. Reacquisition starts with zero linear velocity and the latest physical button snapshot, avoiding a false throw or resurrected release. Stale BLE data or disconnect still releases all inputs even with a visible hand. Explicit forward reset or changing position mode clears both registration and hand-position history. Hand occlusion alone retains orientation registration.

This option depends on the cameras seeing the hand while it holds a controller. Occlusion, latency and alignment during real swings must be evaluated on hardware; synthetic tests do not establish gameplay quality.

### Optional direction adjustment

The default needs no multi-pose calibration. With hand positioning enabled, **Adjust direction (+ / −)** opens a small panel and two live lines, with no controller models or pose-fitting wizard. Point the controllers level and forward with sticks up, look ahead, and choose **Center forward**. Adjust Up/down, Left/right and Twist by one degree with + / −, independently per hand; **Reset to 0°** removes the offsets. The short tick on each line makes twist visible. Changes persist immediately for this game, with a zero default and limits of ±90°. **Done** returns to the launcher.

Every ray's orientation comes from BLE; only its position comes from the matching tracked hand. Center forward fixes a sensor-to-world rotation. Offsets are applied afterward (`world × device × userOffset`, local X/Y/Z order), so recentering or the initial game alignment does not cancel the user's adjustments. Old experimental guided-fit profiles are not used. Position-mode changes, reconnects and stale BLE invalidate registration; hand occlusion alone does not. Lost tracking hides the preview ray. This is an optional comfort adjustment, not a measurement of firmware tracking accuracy.

The preview owns an ARKit session only before gameplay and stops it on exit or startup failure. Starting the game is disabled and guarded while it is open. Gameplay retains the compositor's existing ARKit session. Native-position mode retains its original manual pitch setting; the optional aim offsets are also applied after its world registration.

## Wire input and runtime mapping

The interoperability reference describes a custom service `6E401001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`, pose/input/haptic characteristics with suffixes `1002`/`1003`/`1004`, and optional standard battery service `180F` / characteristic `2A19`.

| Input | Mapping |
| --- | --- |
| Left primary / secondary | Oculus raw X `0x100` / Y `0x200` |
| Right primary / secondary | raw A `0x1` / B `0x2` |
| Left / right stick click | raw `0x400` / `0x4` |
| Left menu / right capture | raw Start `0x100000` / Back `0x200000` |
| Trigger / grip | analog index / hand trigger; raw digital threshold 0.55 |
| Sticks | center 128, signed normalization, radial 0.12 dead zone, unit-circle clamp, optional invert Y |
| Capacitive touch | unavailable in the described input packet; zero, never fabricated |

Buttons use a 13-byte packet (uint64 time, flags, trigger, grip, stick X/Y). Pose packets contain uint64 nanosecond time and 17 float32 values: position, xyzw quaternion, confidence, linear/angular velocity, acceleration. Invalid lengths, nonfinite numbers and degenerate quaternions are rejected. Z is reflected on position/linear vectors; X/Y are negated on quaternion imaginary components and angular velocity, preserving the axial-vector convention. Orientations are normalized.

The reference explicitly labels grip full scale and stick polarity as assumptions. Diagnostics allow 127 or 255 analog full scale and stick Y inversion. Those settings need checking against the actual firmware. No extra system/home button or touch sensor is invented.

Haptics encode the device's 13-byte command, with normalized amplitude mapped to 0–10000, Hz clamped to 20–300 (runtime pulses use 170 Hz) and durations constrained to 30–250 ms. Requests are coalesced per hand. Writes honor GATT properties/backpressure, and response writes do not overlap. Hardware buffered envelopes are approximated by short pulses; sub-30-ms waveforms and frequency fidelity require device testing. The existing runtime pull API supplies amplitude/duration but no frequency.

## Synchronization and prediction

CoreBluetooth owns a dedicated serial queue. The renderer reads a short lock-protected value cache; it never waits for BLE operations or dispatches synchronously to that queue. Packet parsing happens before taking the renderer's cache lock. Haptics use a replaceable pending slot rather than accumulating delayed work.

A constant-memory lower-envelope estimator maps device nanosecond timestamps onto `CACurrentMediaTime`, with clock reset detection and a small clock-drift allowance. One-way BLE timing cannot determine absolute transport delay. Pose prediction uses world-aligned linear/angular velocities and the frame presentation timestamp, capped at 35 ms; it never extrapolates backward. Registration-frame translation/rotation rates are included in published velocities while correcting. Samples older than 250 ms release buttons and analogs and discard registration. Input snapshots are retained between change notifications while a valid pose stream is live.

## Build and validation

From the runtime checkout:

```sh
make surreal                  # decoder/mapping/fusion tests + real project generator checks
make check TARGET=beatsaber140 # existing runtime gates; needs your cached/unpacked game
make -j4 xros                 # real device and simulator runtime compile/link gates
visionos/SurrealHarness/build.sh
```

The diagnostic app compiles the same controller files as the game. With a booted visionOS 26+ simulator:

```sh
xcrun simctl install booted visionos/build/SurrealHarness.app
xcrun simctl launch booted io.avpplay.surreal-diagnostics --surreal-demo --self-test
```

The orange SIMULATED label is mandatory. `--surreal-demo` is compiled only for Simulator and cannot enable fake input on physical Vision Pro. The integration suite covers streaming, handedness, analog input, disconnect/reconnect, simulated haptic routing, mode persistence, hand positioning, sensor-only rotation and manual aim adjustment without losing registration. Results are saved in the harness's Documents/surreal-self-test.json. `--aim-preview` opens the line-only UI with synthetic BLE rotation and illustrative positions. It does not claim real hand tracking or physical calibration. The harness contains no game content.

For a game build, follow BUILDING.md using the same purchased APK and bundle ID as its existing installation. Example (once dependencies and your game tree are present):

```sh
KLEPTON_TARGET=beatsaber140 visionos/mkguest.sh
visionos/mkangle.sh
KLEPTON_TARGET=beatsaber140 KLEPTON_CONTROLLER_MODE=surreal KLEPTON_START_SCREEN=1 python3 visionos/gen_xcodeproj.py
xcodebuild -jobs 2 -project visionos/Klepton.xcodeproj -scheme Klepton \
  -sdk xros -destination 'generic/platform=visionOS' ARCHS=arm64 \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

The last command validates an unsigned product; it does not make an installable signed game. AVP Play's normal installer supplies the existing team and bundle ID and signs it. No controller-specific entitlement was added. The existing Bluetooth, hands and world privacy strings remain in both the plist and generated build settings.

## Hardware acceptance still required

1. Back up saves with AVP Play's existing save feature. Keep the existing game version, bundle prefix, Apple team and per-game toolchain selection.
2. Select the modified toolchain explicitly; choose Surreal Touch in Mac settings. Use Rebuild Controllers for an already installed game with cached data. This runs only the existing build/install step, never fetch, stage, uninstall or save restoration.
3. Pair L/R in the headset launcher, confirm battery/input values and the physical vibration test. Start, hold still and squeeze grip with hands visible.
4. Verify correct hands, world position, grip orientation at multiple yaw/pitch/roll angles, trigger, grip, sticks and all face/menu buttons in Beat Saber. Check fast swings, throws, occlusion, drift and reacquisition.
5. Power off one controller while holding input. Confirm the other remains active and no button is stuck. Reconnect, recalibrate, repeat for the other hand and for Bluetooth off/on.
6. Quit; choose Standard; relaunch without rebuilding. Verify Sense/hand/gamepad behavior separately with available hardware.

The simulator cannot establish radio compatibility, battery reads from hardware, physical tracking quality, real haptic strength, or correct Saber/Touch grip offsets. OpenSurreal's sample can be run separately as a personal reference if you have permission to do so; it was not built or redistributed here.
